## Results
The customer reviews from the Books and Camera datasets were split into vine and non-vine customers in order to see how they vote. Based on the findings below, it wasn't very clear if vine members were more or less trustworthy than non-vine members. There were less vine members for both of the datasets which is understandable since the Vine Program is invite-only. More information will be needed to compare how customers voted before and after joining vine because honestly, what's going to stop someone from anonymous giving their thoughts?

As shown above, there's only two vine members who voted out of over 3 million total customers in this review. They didn't give anything lower than a four-star rating and a handful of votes and helpful votes. However, this wasn't enough members to see if their reviews are trustworthy.

From the 3,105,513 non-vine members who reviewed their purchases, over a million people gave a five-star review. Four and three-star ratings followed after which could mean that the majority of people were pleased by their purchase.

### [Camera Analysis](BigDataAWS_Camera.ipynb)
There were more vine users rating cameras as opposed to books with a total of 7,883 people.
